In this repo are some R scripts and datasets that may be helpful. To run the scripts in R, you will need to set your working directory accordingly (to a downloaded version of this repo if you do that) or put the data somewhere you can find it easily.  

## List of scripts:  

1. - 538_baltimore_plot.R. This script replicates the figure from the fivethirtyeight article on black men in Baltimore, Maryland (available [here](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/how-baltimores-young-black-men-are-boxed-in/)). It is not the same because the data used are different, I was unable to find the exact data from the source fivethirtyeight cited.
